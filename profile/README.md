Welcome to Nova Studios Ltd!

Currently we are working on Orbit! 
Orbit is a messaging platform designed from the ground up to be fully private, customizable and secure.

It's main goal is anonymity, everything is stored in a manner that doesn't allow it to be viewed after it has been stored in our database.

Before you ask, the only thing we store outside of the messages themselves is your email. Your email is stored as a SHA-512 hash
and is only used to verify your identity.
What about messages or files? They are fully encrypted using a Public/Private RSA key pair generate by your client when you first sign up, the private key is the encrypted with your password and stored on our server for you to be able to access anywhere. 

Note: All encryption happens on the client, the server never handles encrypting data. This allows you to maintain control of your data

As of now there is a offical Desktop and Web client. Later down the line there will be support for mobile, but priority right now is optimizing the Web/Desktop client to run well on all devices
